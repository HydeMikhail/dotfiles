# Dotfiles

A collection of all of my dotfiles and configurations that I would like to persist between machines. This utilizes [anishathalye/dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot), which is a nice tool to manage installation and symlinking files (as well as a lot of other things). Check out the repo for tracking your own dotfiles and system configurations.
